Modify Reservation
Hello, I am running late for my reservation. There was a big wine spillage on the highway and we had to help drink all of the wine that was spilling out of the wine truck. We will be there at 10:30am instead. Also, Marissa has taken ill from all of the road wine so I am afraid we will be down to 4 for our table. Thank you - Jane Doe

Cancel Reservation
Hello. I am Samantha Inyo. I have a reservation for next tuesday at 7pm. I need to cancel that reservation because the eclipse will destroy the planet so I cannot come.
